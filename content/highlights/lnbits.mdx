LNbits is a free, open-source Lightning wallet system that sits on top of your existing Lightning node and turns it into a multi-user, multi-wallet platform. Its extension system (over 40 extensions) lets you enable features like a point-of-sale terminal, a faucet, LNURL services, ticket sales, and much more — all running on your own node.

What makes LNbits remarkable is how it transforms a technical Lightning node into an accessible tool for communities, circular economies, and developers. A single LNbits instance can serve as the Lightning backend for an entire village market, a hackathon, or a conference badge system. It's the Swiss Army knife of the Lightning stack.
