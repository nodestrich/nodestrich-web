BTCpay Server is the gold standard for self-hosted Bitcoin and Lightning payment processing. It's a full-featured, open-source platform that lets any merchant accept Lightning payments without giving up custody of funds or paying fees to a third-party processor. It integrates with WooCommerce, Shopify, and dozens of other e-commerce platforms.

For the Lightning community, BTCpay Server is foundational infrastructure. Running your own instance means complete sovereignty — no API keys to revoke, no KYC requirements, no middleman. The project is community-funded and has become the backbone of Lightning commerce for thousands of independent businesses worldwide.
