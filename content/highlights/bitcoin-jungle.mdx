Bitcoin Jungle is a grassroots project in Costa Rica's Nicoya Peninsula building a circular Bitcoin economy, where locals earn sats, spend them at local businesses, and keep value within the community. The accompanying mobile wallet app is designed to be accessible to non-technical users, lowering the barrier to Lightning adoption in a real-world setting.

The project is one of the most-cited examples of a working circular Lightning economy outside of El Salvador. For the global Lightning community, Bitcoin Jungle demonstrates that sovereignty, usability, and local adoption can coexist — and that the right UX can bring Lightning to people who have never heard of a payment channel.
