Words with Zaps is a word game (think Wordle with a social twist) built natively on Nostr, where players can send and receive zaps as part of gameplay. It's a playful demonstration that Nostr's social protocol and Lightning's payment layer aren't just for serious finance — they're a platform for apps of all kinds.

Games like this matter for the ecosystem because they bring in users who might not otherwise care about nodes or routing. When someone plays Words with Zaps and receives their first zap, they've just had their first Lightning payment experience in a context that feels natural and fun rather than intimidating.
