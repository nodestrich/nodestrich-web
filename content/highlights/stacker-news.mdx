Stacker.news is a link aggregator and discussion forum modeled after Hacker News, but with one key difference: every upvote costs a small number of sats, and those sats flow directly to the poster and commenters. Spam becomes economically irrational, and quality content earns real money.

The platform demonstrates Lightning's potential as an anti-spam mechanism and micropayment rail simultaneously. For the Lightning community, Stacker.news is both a watering hole for technical discussion and a live showcase that value-for-value economics can work at the application layer.
