Fountain is a podcast player built around the value4value (V4V) model: as you listen, sats stream automatically to the podcasters and their guests, split according to whatever value split they've configured. Listeners can also send one-time "boosts" with a message, creating a new kind of real-time audience engagement.

For the Lightning ecosystem, Fountain is proof that micropayments can replace advertising as a sustainable creator economy model. It implements the Podcasting 2.0 spec, meaning any podcast app supporting Lightning can interoperate — no platform lock-in, just open standards and sats flowing where they're deserved.
