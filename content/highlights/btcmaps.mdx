BTCmaps is a community-maintained, open-source map showing over 6,000 businesses and venues that accept Bitcoin and Lightning payments worldwide. Built on OpenStreetMap data, it makes it easy for Bitcoiners to find places to spend sats in their city or while traveling.

The project is entirely community-driven — anyone can add or verify a location, making it a living atlas of Lightning adoption. For node runners, BTCmaps is both a practical resource and a measure of the circular economy's growth: every new pin is evidence that Lightning is moving beyond speculation into everyday commerce.
