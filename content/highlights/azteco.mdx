Azteco sells Bitcoin vouchers at convenience stores, newsagents, and retail chains in dozens of countries — redeemable instantly over Lightning. The model mirrors how prepaid mobile top-ups work: buy a voucher with cash, redeem a code, and receive sats in your Lightning wallet within seconds. No bank account, no KYC, no app install required to purchase.

For the Lightning community, Azteco solves a genuine onboarding problem: how do you get sats to someone who is unbanked or simply prefers cash? By piggybacking on existing retail distribution networks, Azteco extends Lightning's reach far beyond the technically inclined, making it a critical bridge between the physical cash economy and the Lightning network.
