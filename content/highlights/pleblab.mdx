PlebLab is a Bitcoin-focused hackerspace and startup accelerator based in Austin, Texas, offering desk space, mentorship, and community to builders working on open-source Bitcoin and Lightning projects. It hosts hackathons, demo days, and physical Lightning payment demonstrations — including hardware wallets, point-of-sale devices, and experimental node setups.

The space is notable for its emphasis on hands-on building rather than speculative discussion. PlebLab alumni have shipped tools used across the Lightning ecosystem, and its open-door policy for Bitcoin developers makes it a hub for the kind of cross-pollination that leads to new protocols and products. If you're building on Lightning, PlebLab is where you want to be in Austin.
