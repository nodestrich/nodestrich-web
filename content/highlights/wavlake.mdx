Wavlake is a music streaming platform that integrates Lightning payments and Nostr zaps, letting fans send sats directly to artists with zero intermediary cut. Artists upload tracks, set a value split between band members, and fans can stream or zap individual songs — all without a label or platform taking the majority cut.

The combination of Nostr's social graph and Lightning's payment layer makes Wavlake a compelling alternative to streaming incumbents. For Nostr node runners especially, Wavlake represents the convergence of two open protocols into something that can genuinely support independent musicians.
